; Part 0: Semantic aliases

#|
(attributes table)
  table: a valid table (i.e., a list of lists as specified by assigment)

  Returns a list of the attributes in 'table', in the order they appear.
|#
(define attributes (void))

#|
(tuples table)
  table: a valid table

  Returns a list of all tuples in 'table', in the order they appear.
  Note: it is possible for 'table' to contain no tuples.
|#
(define tuples (void))

#|
(size table)
  table: a valid table

  Returns the number of tuples in 'table'.
|#
(define size (void))


; Part I "WHERE" helpers; you may or may not wish to implement these.

#|
A function that takes: 
  - a list of attributes
  - a string (representing an attribute)
  - a tuple

  and returns the value of the tuple corresponding to that attribute.
|#

#|
A function that takes:
  - f: a unary function that takes a tuple and returns a boolean value
  - table: a valid table

  and returns a new table containing only the tuples in 'table'
  that satisfy 'f'.
|#

#|
A function 'replace-attr' that takes:
  - x 
  - a list of attributes

  and returns a function 'f' which takes a tuple and does the following:
    - If 'x' is in the list of attributes, return the corrresponding value 
      in the tuple.
    - Otherwise, just ignore the tuple and return 'x'.

; What should this macro do?
(define-syntax replace
  (syntax-rules ()
    ; The recursive step, when given a compound expression
    [(replace (expr ...) table)
     ; Change this!
     (void)]
    ; The base case, when given just an atom. This is easier!
    [(replace atom table)
     ; Change this!
     (void)]))
